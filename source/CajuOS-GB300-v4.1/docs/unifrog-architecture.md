# UniFrog Architecture

UniFrog is a native SF2000 runtime, a MuOS-inspired native frontend, optional JS2300
scripts, and SD-loaded modules.

## Runtime Boundary

The native runtime owns hardware-specific and expensive work: framebuffer and
GE presentation, PCM output, controller input, battery sampling, logging,
storage paths, media playback, standby/reboot, fastboot firmware handoff, cache
maintenance, and libretro hosting.

Public C interfaces live under `include/unifrog/`. Code outside the native
runtime should not include private headers from `src/`.

The build emits:

## Frontend Boundary

`FRONTEND_IMPL=native` is the only boot frontend. It builds UniFrog native
frontend code in `src/native_frontend.c` and renders through
`src/frontend_lvgl.c`. The UI keeps MuOS-inspired launcher, explore,
collection, history, information, and configuration flows without requiring the
upstream MuOS checkout.

The package keeps distribution files under `/unifrog` and mutable state under
`/unifrog_data`. Native frontend code uses `unifrog/ui.h` for framebuffer presentation and
normalized menu input, and calls public runtime services such as content
launch, media playback, backlight, firmware handoff, and storage diagnostics.
The in-game quick menu is compiled into the libretro host, so no JavaScript
frontend files are required on the SD card.

## JavaScript Boundary

`js2300/` embeds MQuickJS and registers native bindings. It is no longer a
frontend implementation. The native frontend exposes Apps -> JavaScript Scripts
for optional standalone scripts in `/unifrog_data/scripts`; the native frontend,
quick menu, themes, and diagnostics stay in C/LVGL-side code.

The JS2300 host bridge is split by role:

- `src/frontend/js2300_frontend.c`: JS2300 host wiring and native script entry
- `src/frontend/js2300_frontend_bindings.c`: script logging, timing,
  filesystem, battery, backlight, AV, and lightweight indexing bindings
- `src/frontend/js2300_frontend_actions.c`: script-triggered diagnostics and
  system checks
- `src/frontend/js2300_frontend_storage.c`: storage diagnostics

Updating optional scripts does not require relinking firmware. Updating native
bindings, runtime modules, or ABI headers requires a rebuild.

## Core Boundary

Generic emulator modules are libretro cores. UniFrog-specific modules, such as
`/unifrog/modules/hcrtos-media.bin`, use the same loader and the versioned ABI
table in `include/unifrog/abi.h` for device services.

Module binaries retain the licenses of their upstream sources. The active
inventory lives in `../THIRD_PARTY.md`; `cores/manifest.mk` and
`cores/patches/` are the reproducible source contract for libretro modules.

ABI rules:

- ABI-visible structs start with `size` and version or magic fields.
- Existing fields stay stable; additive callbacks go at the end.
- Callers must tolerate missing callbacks.
- Private `src/` symbols and raw linker addresses are not stable contracts.

External loading details live in `external-core-loading.md`; fixed memory
regions live in `memory-layout.md`.
